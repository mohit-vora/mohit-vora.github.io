I came across job description (referred as JD in rest of the post) on the internet. I could not understand the role clearly. I went ahead and googled a line of that JD and i could find same JD posted by different companies for same role. This is not the first time I feel confused after reading JD. Hence this is an open letter to all the hiring managers / recruiters out there. 

Why copypasta JD is bad?

### 1. You are mis-leading candidate on expectations

When you copy paste a stock JD or JD posted by some other company, you are mis-communicating skills/requirements required for this role. Source JD might require candidates to know python but the role that you want works with Java. But you don't bother to change that. Either the candidate finds it out during one of the interview rounds if candidate asked interviewee of tech-stack, by chance. Otherwise candidate finds it out directly when they get hired and start working.

### 2. Adds additional cost to entire role closure

Because your copy pasted JD contains information which are not accurate to actual role expectations, candidates/you will discover mis-fit later in the acquisition position. But your team/you/candidates have invested time through the process till mis-fit is discovered. By mis-fit i mean at least one of the requirements is a blocker for either you or the candidate. For eg. you forgot to mention candidate might have to work in different timezone than their base location and candidate is not happy with that. Candidate discovers this in 1st or subsequent rounds. The later candidate discovers this fact, more is the cost of acquisition. Time is money.

### 3. You lost an opportunity to grab candidates attention and make them feel excited about this role

Most of the JDs are so boring and are copy pasted. Many just randomly apply to each job listing they see across until they land at least one offer letter. To candidates, all the job listings are same, unless they are GAFAM company (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft) or a NATU company (Netflix, Airbnb, Tesla, Uber). Don't you think you are better than other thousand's of companies with same role opening? Well at least you pretend that you are better than others coz you wanna close this role fast and sell yourself hard to get great candidates. :) You are loosing on that opportunity to outshine on the JD and grab candidate's attention. Wouldn't you like that candidate be eager to hear back from you when they apply for the role?

## Line by line analysis:

This is a Technical Support Engineer role JD. Here is what i find inappropriate.

> Oversee the resolution of all technical issues coming from channel partners and ISVs, including high-urgency issues requiring engineering assistance

- What is ISV?
- Who are channel partners?

***

> Serve as a front line contact through a series of actions either via phone, email or chat with our teams, until they’ve solved a technical issue

Common, technical support is not done on phone/email in current world. Its all beacons, chatbots, JIRA, Asana nowadays. You can do better by sharing better specifics here.

***

> Troubleshoot, debug, and diagnose issues encountered in the field

In the field? This is not a CIA operative role. You perhaps meant production (tech teams have different versions of their product: test version, production version, etc.)

***

> Maintain day-to-day operations and documentation of global cloud-based production systems

- What do you mean by day-to-day operations?
- You could have used term **system behavior** instead of **global cloud-based production systems**.
- Not so bad, but why should a Technical Support Engineer maintain documentation for your system behavior. They are just starting with that role. Each new feature is first touched by Product Manager, Designer, Developer, Test Engineer. All those are better roles to document system behavior than a Tech Support Engineer.

***

> Beginner level programming skills preferably in Python - should be able to read through the piece of code.

Instead **should be able to connect reported issue to relevant code to pin point the problem** would be a better line item. Any one can read code. On a separate note, how would you test them on this requirement during interview? Do you have a sample test application with source code as a part of your interview process where you can evaluate candidate on this skill? If not, what value does it add to keep this line in the job description? Only skills which are measurable make sense in JD. Some do have relevant rounds to test this skill. But often times, most don't.

***

> Excellent communication skills and potential to interact directly with business teams

Do you have mechanisms to evaluate candidate whether they can *interact directly with business teams*? 

***

> Ability to create SQL queries for analysis of issues and reporting

You just mentioned it above already *Should be able to write basic SQL queries to pull out relevant data from our MySQL databases*. 

***

> Ability to support business teams issues from operations and technical perspective

You're repeating again. Following things suffice to communicate what you mean.

- Oversee the resolution of all technical issues coming from channel partners and ISVs, including high-urgency issues requiring engineering assistance
- Serve as a front line contact through a series of actions either via phone, email or chat with our teams, until they’ve solved a technical issue

***

> Experience with debugging complex problems through configuration files, logs, and code pieces to determine the source of failure

Repetitive again. You just mentioned same thing when you mentioned _Troubleshoot, debug, and diagnose issues encountered in the field_. Both can be combined into one may be.

***

> Good Problem Solving Skills

Multiple expectations communicate this very same thing, even the previous point in this article. But wait, you (hiring manager) smarty pants. You want the candidate to be able to write python program on a matrix inverse abstract programming question in the interview. That's what you meant when you said problem solving skills. 

Wait what? You don't want candidate to write a single line of code in their day to day work, but during one of the interviews you want to test them if they can solve a stupid (coz they do not need to know for this role) abstract problem. That's not a fair expectation.

I know this is wild assumption but there is no other explanations on why someone would mention this otherwise in JD for Tech Support Engineer. Also usually hiring managers mean to evaluate candidates on such coding exercises when they refer to Problem Solving round in day-to-day lingo.

***

> Mentioning intro about company multiple times in the JD.

To cut you some seconds of reading, i am refraining myself from sharing exact lines here. But you started the JD with a paragraph of what your company does and how cool it is. In the end you mention another paragraph of how awesome your company is, again. 

***

## PS

- This is not rant. This is a constructive feedback to all the hiring managers out there. Please put some time into writing clean and easy to understand JD. 
- Try not to refer to other JD since that would bias your actual requirements. You would be tempted to include some lines in your JD because they look nice in someone else's JD. 
- If you have no clue what would be JD for a role, likely that you are not fit for writing it in first place. Get someone experienced to write that for you.
- Get your JD reviewed by someone who knows that role (another Technical Support Engineer in your team/company) and someone not so related to this role (Product owner/ Software developer). 
- Try to write expectations in terms of actual thing that candidate would have to do rather than abstract word play.
