All I've learnt, changed, achieved and discovered in 2020. I wanna do this at the end of each year to synthesise pattern eventually and discover myself and surrounding.

### learned

- I've revised my car driving skills from merely holding a driving license to actually being able to drive on roads with traffic.

- I've learned to cook functionally. Meaning I can feed myself round the year sustainably and occasionally friends/family.

- Ukulele, Guitar, Cajon, Kalimba (I already know synthesizer since 2 decades, about time I expanded horizontally. Lockdown helped a lot.) 

- VueJS + Django (built a side project at work)

- Putting together this blog

- Listen more and speak less

- That one of my strengths is understanding what someone needs at work without them having to say it or knowing what they actuall want

- Selling myself better

- German on DuoLingo

- to hold sensitive information from people and not spread it around.

### changed

- Political leaning. All these years I've been supporter of what my dad taught me was a great political party, leader. 

- I consume much less sugar. Mostly to be socially compatible. (I have house mate, friends, family who are still normal happy beings.) Its no longer a discipline or that I control myself, I naturally do not feel like missing sugary treats anymore.

- Grooming. I get better hair cut from better place, in good time. I wear relatively smart clothes. I prefer quality over price than my earlier self.

- I eat between 10 AM - 6 PM daily (except on social gatherings)

- I try to adhere to <a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/a-z/raw-foods-diet">raw food diet</a>

- I deleted my facebook/instagram accounts.

- Work stream. From software test engineer to product management.

- Lost touch with my college best friends.

### achieved

- Lean physique

- I've never missed workouts more than 2 days in a row

- Reduced netflix, primevideo, youtube consumption significantly (1 hour per day)

- Lived alone for a month in Bangalore

- No alcohol, smoke

- Growth mindset

- Started reading consistently (The art of saying No, Predictably irrational, 21 Lessons for 21st Century)
