I studied Electronics Engineering in college from 2010 till 2014. In my final year, I started working at a Building Automation startup on Z-Wave protocol. They were trying to create something like <a href="https://getvera.com/">this</a> from OEMs. I helped in communications with Alibaba manufacturers, hardware testing, Android App Development, Lua Scripting, liasoning with UI Design consultant, etc.

In 2015, I started working at a leading IT Indian bluechip company <a href="https://www.infosys.com/">Infosys</a> as corporate trainer for 4 years. I learnt Mainframes, Test Automation, Oops, CI-CD, etc. I taught all these topics to freshers and existing employees. I also created course contents and test evaluation tools.

I was quite satisfied teaching. But I became comfortable and started missing hustle at a startup. So now I work at <a href="https://www.springboard.com/">Springboard</a> since 2018. Primarily i ensure quality in new feature releases. I also pioneered automated Visual Tests using <a href="https://www.percy.io">Percy.io</a>. I also worked very closely with Business teams to answer product behviour queries, fix production bugs. I also wrote code for a contractor payment functionality using Vue.js + Django.

I get excited by writing software to solve real world problems currently and for foreseeable future.
